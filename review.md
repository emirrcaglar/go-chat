  1. Project Structure

  What's Good:

   * Clear Separation of Concerns: You've done a good job of separating the code into packages (cmd, routes, server, types).
     This makes the project easy to navigate and understand.
   * Standard Go Practices: The use of go.mod for dependency management and a Makefile for common commands are excellent
     practices.

  Suggestions:

   * Configuration: The server port (:3000) is currently hardcoded in cmd/main.go. For better flexibility, consider managing
     configuration through environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., config.yaml). Libraries like viper can be
     very helpful for this.
   * Static Assets: If you were to add dedicated CSS or JavaScript files, they would typically go into a static/ or assets/
     directory, which would then be served as static files by your application.

  2. Go Backend Code

  What's Good:

   * Clear Entry Point: cmd/main.go is clean and easy to follow. It clearly shows how the server is initialized and started.
   * Good Use of Interfaces: The RegisterRoutes function takes a *server.Server, which is a good example of how different
     components of your application can interact.

  Suggestions:

   * Concurrency Safety: In server/server.go, you have a mutex to protect access to the rooms map, which is excellent.
     However, in the readLoop, you access s.roomStore.Rooms[id] and then call room.AddMessage without a lock. If multiple
     users were to send messages in the same room at the same time, you could have a race condition when appending to the
     MessageHistory slice. You should add a mutex to the types.Room struct to protect access to its data.
   * Error Handling: The error handling is good, but could be more consistent. Some errors are logged with log.Printf, while
     others use fmt.Printf. Using a structured logger (like slog, which is built-in since Go 1.21) would be a great
     improvement. It allows for leveled logging (info, debug, error) and makes your logs much easier to parse and query.
   * Graceful Shutdown: The server currently stops abruptly on error or when the process is killed. It would be good practice
     to implement a graceful shutdown. This involves listening for OS signals (like SIGINT or SIGTERM) and giving the server a
      moment to close existing connections and save any necessary data before exiting.

  3. Frontend Code (HTML/JS)

  What's Good:

   * Effective Use of Go Templates: You're using Go's built-in templating engine well to render the initial page views.

  Suggestions:

   * Duplicated Rendering Logic: As we've discussed, the biggest issue on the frontend is the duplicated rendering logic
     between the Go templates (for the initial page load) and the JavaScript socket.onmessage handler (for new messages). The
     HTML-over-the-wire approach we talked about is the ideal solution for this.
   * Hardcoded WebSocket URL: The WebSocket URL is constructed with ws://localhost:3000. This will break if you deploy the
     application to a different host or port. It's better to construct this URL dynamically based on the browser's current
     location (window.location).
   * Consolidate Styles: You have some inline styles in your HTML (e.g., in room.html). It's generally better to move all
     styles into the central <style> tag in layout.html or into a dedicated .css file. This makes your styling much easier to
     manage and maintain.

  4. Overall Architecture

  What's Good:

   * Simple and Effective: The architecture is simple, easy to understand, and very effective for a real-time chat
     application. It's a great example of a standard Go web application.

  Suggestions:

   * Persistence: The chat rooms and messages are currently stored in memory, which means they are lost every time the server
     restarts. The next logical step for this project would be to add a database (like SQLite for simplicity, or PostgreSQL
     for a more production-ready solution) to persist this data.
   * Authentication: The current username system is good for a demo, but for a real application, you would want to implement a
     more robust authentication system, likely with user registration and password hashing.

  Conclusion

  This is a very solid project that demonstrates a good understanding of Go web development. The code is clean and
  functional. The suggestions above are primarily focused on improving robustness, maintainability, and scalabilityâ€”the key
  things you would focus on when moving a project from a prototype to a production-ready application.
